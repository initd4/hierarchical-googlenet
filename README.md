# Hierarchical GoogLeNet

* Hierarchical Approach in Large Scale Image Recognition with Deep Learning
* ILSVRC 2015 - Miletos Team Entry (Results : http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/results)
* Took the 19th place in ILSVRC 2015 using without model and scale ensembling
* Took the 1st place in several classes (red fox, brown bear) in classification track

## Abstract

* Hierarchical GoogLeNet is an adaptation of the GoogLeNet to use hierarchical category structure in the data for ILSVRC – Localization competition. Architecture of the Hierarchical GoogLeNet is the same as architecture of plain GoogLeNet.

* There is a hierarchical structure in object categories and this hierarchical structure of the data is compatible with WordNet Tree. In WordNet Tree, objects are hierarchically categorised into a tree structure.

* Hierarchical GoogLeNet is trained by considering this hierarchical structure of categories.
